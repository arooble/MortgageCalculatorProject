# MortgageCalculatorProject

<h1>Mortgage Calculator Project</h1>
<p>I developed a Java console project for a mortgage calculator, enabling users to input their loan principal, prevailing interest rate, and loan term. This project dissects the initial loan amount into monthly payments until the outstanding balance reaches zero, all while considering the specified loan term for the calculations.</p>
